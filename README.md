# Cluster regression model for control of nonlinear dynamics.
The code does the following
- Generates time series data for the forced Lorenz system
- Clusters the Lorenz attractor using kmeans clustering
- Generates a predictive model for the trajectories based on cluster centroids
- Drive the trajectory towards a point located outside the attractor.
